Step 1: Configure Kali Linux Repositories
The first step is to set correct Kali Linux repositories. Make sure that your /etc/apt/sources.list file contains the following official Kali repositories: 
#############################################################################
deb https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib           # 
deb-sources https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free contrib   #
#############################################################################

Step 2: Update Kali Linux
Open up terminal and enter:

$ apt update

optionally, display all packages which are scheduled for update:

$ apt list --upgradable

At this stage we have an option to upgrade individual packages using apt install PACKAGE-NAME or upgrade all packages at once:

$ sudo apt upgrade

All done. Your Kali Linux system is now fully upgraded.

Step 3: Upgrade Kept Back Packages
Due to package dependency changes some of the Kali Linux packages might be kept back.

If this is this case you will be notified by the apt upgrade Linux command at the end of the Kali Linux upgrade process. You may upgrade each kept back package individually using the apt install PACKAGE-NAME command or update all kept back packages at once:

$ sudo apt dist-upgrade

Step 4: Uninstall No Longer Required Packages
During your initial system upgrade some of the packages may become obsolete, hence are no longer required. To remove all no longer required Kali Linux packages execute:

$ sudo apt autoremove
